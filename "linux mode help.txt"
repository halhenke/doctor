* Desktop Configuration
Use:
$ dconf-editor
to change many hidden/non-obvious settings in Linux
Also: 
Settings->Keyboard->Shortcut
AND
Settings->Keyboard Layout
for various weird things

* Package Management

** Update Package List
$ apt-get update

** Search for package
e.g. port search package
$ apt-cache search package
OR to match against/search only the package names
$ apt-cache search -n package


** Info on package
e.g. port info package
$ apt-cache show package
or more detail
$ apt-cache showpkg package


** Package Dependencies
apt-cache depends sbcl

** Show installed packages
e.g. port installed | grep python
$ dpkg --get-selections | grep python
OR
$ dpkg -l

** Show available packages
$ apt-cache pkgnames

** Show which version of a package is installed
e.g. port installed | grep python
$ dpkg -l | grep package

** Show which packages a package needs that arent yet installed


Show which package dependecies our SYSTEM currently has unfulfilled
$ apt-cache unmet package

Show where files from a package are installed
$ dpkg-query -L bash-completion

Reconfigure package
$ dpkg-reconfigure packagename



* Server/Apache Management

** Restart the server
$ sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
OR
$ service apache2 reload
OR
$ apache2ctl restart

other useful stuff maybe:
check and modify which apache modules are available and enabled
$ a2enmod
copies a site from available to enabled directory of apache:
$ a2ensite drupal-cat-au-website.conf  

User name that runs apache etc is set in:
/etc/apache2/envvars

However are we restarting
/etc/init.d/apache2
OR
 /usr/sbin/apache2

** Available/Enabled Sites

I edited the apache2 file:
/etc/apache2/sites-available/default
adding:
    Alias /hal/ "/home/hal/work/"
    <Directory "/home/hal/work/">
        Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride None
        Order deny,allow
        Deny from all
        Allow from 127.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 ::1/128
    </Directory>
so that i can access my /home/hal/work folder at the URL:
http://localhost/hal/

Later we added
a file:
drupal-cat-au-website.conf 
to the directory:
/etc/apache2/sites-available
This specified some site specific error/access logging in a new directory/file
/var/log/sitelogs/drupal-site-cat-au-website/
did:
$ chgrp www-data /var/log/sitelogs/drupal-site-cat-au-website/
$ chmod g+w /var/log/sitelogs/drupal-site-cat-au-website/
$ a2ensite drupal-cat-au-website.conf 

** Hosts file
Also have to add the line:
127.0.0.1 d.catalyst-au.net
to /etc/hosts where d.catalyst-au.net is the SeverName from drupal-cat-au-website.conf 


* Postgres Setup

First grant yourself superuser privileges:
sudo -su postgres createuser yourname

list databases
$ psql -l

Then login with 
psql -d databasename


Databases live in
/var/lib/postgresql/9.1/main/
Configuration lives in
/etc/postgresql/9.1/main/
Log files live in:
/var/log/postgres

sudo -u postgres 

Create Database and then
psql databasename < data_base_dump

Restart postgres with
sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql restart

Also - 
in pg_hba.conf under: 
# IPv4 local connections:
we changed:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            md5
to:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust

which meant we dont have to provide passwords for local connections (in drush at least)

* Drupal Setup With Postgres - FRESH INSTALL

Important last step - Grant all:

CREATE DATABASE drupaldb;
CREATE USER drupalapp WITH PASSWORD 'lapurd';
GRANT ALL ON DATABASE drupalbd TO drupalapp;

But also - if you have already set $db_url in settings.php
then drupal assumes the site is already setup and tries to read the presumably empty database
See: 
http://drupal.org/node/965028
So you have to go to your_site_root_url/install.php
to call the setup explicitly

* Drupal Site Config

Need the php postgres driver
$ sudo apt-get install php5-pgsql

php log in:
...

* Below relates by example to the Catalyst Australian website: cat-au-website

Site was "stored" in two parts - a git repository with the drupal code/directory structure: 
$ git clone git+ssh://gitprivate.catalyst.net.nz/git/private/drupal/cat-au-website.git cat-au-website
and a 
pg_dump backup of the postgres database on the machine vedra:
root@vedra://data/rsync/cabotage/var/backups/pg/pg-9.0-main/current/pg-catalyst_website-2012-11-06-220105.pgdump
To get this database from vedra i  logged into vedra as root:
$ ssh vedra

Sites are deployed onto the machine "bordon"
into the 
/var/www/drupal-site-cat-au-website
I copied the sites/default/settings.php file from here to my machine and made a couple of changes:
changed:
$conf["archimedes_site_environment"] = "staging";
to:
$conf["archimedes_site_environment"] = "development";
had to change the database settings:
$db_url["default"] = "pgsql://catalyst_website:Eu4mee5hAuk1pa7v@db-host/catalyst_website";
to:
$db_url["default"] = "pgsql://catalyst_website:Eu4mee5hAuk1pa7v@localhost/hal/cat-au-website/";

Also - so that the site cannot write to its own directory/self:
I created a directory
/var/lib/sitedata/cat-au-drupal/files/ (could be anywhere)
and then created a symlink to it 
sites/default/files -> /var/lib/sitedata/cat-au-drupal/files/


** Drupal Update Module Procedure:
1 Login as admin
2 Go to available updates
3 Click on Download for an outdated module (Yellow/Red) sorted by urgency (Red first)
4 Save in some tmp directory
5 cd to site directory/sites/all/modules
6 Find directory where module is - 
Could be: 
contrib/
patched/
custom/
or, if older project, everything in the one directory
BE CAREFUL IF IT IS A MODULE IN PATCHED - you willl have to apply patches again or modify/ignore patches if module no longer needs them.
otherwise:
7 tar -xvf ~/directory_where_tgz_is_downloaded/old-module.tgz    in_parent_directory_of_old-module
will update/replace old module.
8 Create a new branch 
8 Commit changes per module (easier to use git bisect to trace the problem if an update breaks the site)
9 Push new branch to remote repo before your machine dies....
10 If all is cool - deploy via API1 method described here:
https://wiki.wgtn.cat-it.co.nz/wiki/Drupal/Getting_Started#For_API_1
Wiki is wrong -  
$options['dh-project'] = 'cat-au-website';
is set in drushrc.local.php and not drushrc.php
However API-1 method still seems to apply to Drupal 6 sites - at least thre are no 6.x versions of debuild
only 7.x-1.0 and 7.x-2.0

I did
$ sudo apt-get install apache2-mpm-itk
which removed:
apache2-mpm-prefork
may want to reverse this situation later.....


* Drush & Drush Problems

You should make sure you have the Catalyst version.
The one from git is more recent than the one from the Catalyst stable/unstable repository

If you get the error 
"No valid version control or backup engine found (the --version-control option was set to "git")"
Then you are probably not working in a git repository
 - if you didnt clone it somewhere then just 'git ini't

* Drupal Deployment
See here:
https://wiki.wgtn.cat-it.co.nz/wiki/Catalyst_Australia_Pty_Ltd/Catalyst_Australia_Debian_repository

Finish changes.
Run drush dh-make-drupal
This will make a package to install on the server and a changelist

You then have to put this package AND the changelist in the staging environment
$ scp drupal-site-cat-au-website_20121112-1_all.deb caldara:/repo-stage
$ scp drupal-site-cat-au-website_20121112-1_amd64.changes caldara:/repo-stage

Now we put it on the server, in this case 'bordon'

$ ssh bordon
This server then generates a gpg password file which we can use to get a onetime password for this session.
Copy the contents of this file to our own machine 
$ cat password.txt.gpg
and grab everything e.g.:

-----END PGP MESSAGE-----

and save it in a local file (any name will do e.g. password_tmp.txt)
Then:
$ gpg -d password_tmp.txt
Enter secret phrase and we now have a shell password to work on bordon.
If we want to set something more permanentwe can use this to change our password for bordon via the command:
$ passwd
We then run 
$ sudo apt-get update
presumably so that we can see that the package is available from the staging area.
And then:
$ dpkg -l | grep cat-au
$ sudo apt-get install drupal-site-cat-au-website 
Just to be careful update the database:
$ drush updatedb
and clear the cache
$ drush cc all

To check it out (become root):
$ sudo -s
$ cd /var/www/drupal-site-cat-au-website/
$ ls -lta

There is a gpg thing which gi


* Getting Important Passwords

$ ssh turing
then use:
$ pview -d sydney catalyst-au.net
where sydney is a group and catalyst-au-net is a search term IIRC
This returns a format
catalyst-au drupal site - email_address



* Git commands

List all files in a branch (recursively)
git ls-tree -r branch

git ls-tree -r branch | wc -l

git diff --name-only updates_2012_11-core-upgrade upstream/6.x |wc -l

What bevan did:
git branch updates_2012_11-core-upgrade
git checkout updates_2012_11-core-upgrade
git checkout upstream/catalyst-6.x
git checkout -b catalyst-6.x
git pull upstream catalyst-6.x

git merge catalyst-6.x

What i did:
git branch updates_2012_11-core-upgrade
git checkout updates_2012_11-core-upgrade

* Things I learned Trying to Speed up KDE

** $ free -m
total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:          7967       6094       1873          0         62        936

** Turn the swap off
$ sudo swapoff -a
and on
$ sudo swapon -a

** Look at the "swappiness"
$ cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness 

** See here:
http://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=66&t=85803
We edit the system file:
/etc/sysctl.conf
adding the following lines:
# HAL - trying to make KDE snappier
vm.swappiness=20
vm.vfs_cache_pressure=50

** This thread is the greatest:
http://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=66&t=85803&sid=ee5334e50b6b877d1b5e644b07f355ad&start=15
possible causes:
 - akonadiserver / akonadi processes 
 - Fixing the application which excessively spawns kio_trash would help also. 
Grepping ~/.xsession-errors for " Killing update job for "trash:/"" may help reveal the culprit, with the KIO debugging area enabled. KRunner does this intensively.
 - Nepomuk 
 - the Oxygen widget style

** Dealing With Akonadi
The Akonadi server is launched automatically at login whenever any Akonadi-enabled application requests access to it.

To disable the Akonadi subsystem, first, shut down the running Akonadi server from the control module or the command line:

akonadictl stop
Now, edit the file ~/.config/akonadi/akonadiserverrc and change StartServer from true to false:

StartServer=false
The Akonadi server should no longer launch automatically on login.
